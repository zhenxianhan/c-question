4. The automatic properties is more clear. And is easy to use.
5. Using statement is more convenient to use.
6. The dynamic type variable is tell the compiler that the variable can be change.
7. Is operator is check if the object is compatible.
8. Generics is let you define specific data in class or method, is useful because it allow you use any data type with class and method.
9. Any public access allows.
10. Yes, you can.
11. Use array.sort. And put the numbers in.
12. If you have a uncertain value, you use the nullable type.
13. Enumeration is a set of name and is distinct type.
14. Inheritance is allow one class inherit another class.

19. Continue make next round start, but break is end the function.
20. This is just show the current case.
21. Try is block and catch is to find the exception.
22. exception is a response to the exception happened in the code.

28. Abstract is a class cannot achieve Multiple inheritances and can contain static members and constructor.
29. The Interface can achieve Multiple inheritances and Interface cannot contain static members and constructor.
30. Method is code block contains set of statements.
31. Property is that class member can work on it.
32. Access specifier is a scope of accessibility of object and members.
